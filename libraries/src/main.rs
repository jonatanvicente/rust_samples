  Libraries:
    *bytes - Efficient mechanism for passing around subslices of a single piece of contiguous memory without having to copy or deal with lifetimes
    *criterion - A statistics-driven micro-benchmarking library
    *cxx - Safe interop between Rust and C++
    *flume - Multi-producer, multi-consumer channel that is faster, more flexible, and simpler than the one included with the Rust standard library.
    *hdrhistogram - A High Dynamic Range (HDR) Histogram implementation in Rust
    *heapless - Supplies data structures that do not use the heap
    *itertools - Extends the Iterator trait from the standard library with lots of new convenient methods for deduplication, grouping, and computing powersets
    *nix - Idiomatic bindings to system calls on Unix-like systems
    *pin-project - Macros that enforce the pinning safety invariants for annotated types, which in turn provide a safe pinning interface to those types
    *ring - Cryptography library
    *slab - Efficient data structure to use in place of HashMap<Token, T>, where Token is an opaque type used only to differentiate between entries in the map
    *static_assertions - Assertions that are evaluated at, and thus may fail at, compile time
    *structopt - Describe your applicationâ€™s command line interface
    *thiserror - A library for deriving the Error trait for your custom error types
    *tower - Takes the function signature async fn(Request) -> Response and implements an entire ecosystem on top of it
    *tracing - Efficiently trace the execution
