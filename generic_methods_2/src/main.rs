/*
        Calling mixup on p1 with the argument p2 gives us p3, which will have an i32 for x, because x came from p1.
        The p3 variable will have a char for y, because y came from p2. The println! macro call will print p3.x = 5, p3.y = c.

        The purpose of this example is to demonstrate a situation in which some generic parameters are declared
        with impl and some are declared with the method definition. Here, the generic parameters X1 and Y1 are declared
        after impl because they go with the struct definition. The generic parameters X2 and Y2 are declared after fn mixup,
        because theyâ€™re only relevant to the method.
